# Trick-or-Treat
OBJECTIVE: As Halloween approaches, you decide to go trick or treating with friends, and want to document your memories using your knowledge of object-oriented programming. Some of your friends decide to be witches, and some decide to be ghosts. All of you are trick or treaters, and all of you want to keep track of the total amount of candy you get.
There are 5 classes for this project: TrickOrTreater, Ghost, Witch,BlackCat, andHappyHalloween.Each of these has constructors, methods, and variables that are described below.A lot of the code will be reused through inheritance.

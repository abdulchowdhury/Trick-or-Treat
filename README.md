# Trick-or-Treat
OBJECTIVE: As Halloween approaches, you decide to go trick or treating with friends, and want to document your memories using your knowledge of object-oriented programming. Some of your friends decide to be witches, and some decide to be ghosts. All of you are trick or treaters, and all of you want to keep track of the total amount of candy you get.
